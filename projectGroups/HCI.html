                    WebLingo is a project that aims to help people who are either learning a new language, or are trying to improve their enligh. The project is still in development, but it aims to provide real world examples of languages being used on the web.

                    In this first iteration of designing Weblingo, we took into account the feedback we recieved from our interviews held. The key aspects are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Translation: The translation feature allows users to translate any text they find on the website. This feature would be first thing someone who is using a language chrome extention would expect.</li>
                        <li>Pronouciation: Being able to hear the word you are trying to learn would be an extra step of study for anyone learning new vocabulary.</li>
                        <li>Quizzes: One of the main parts of the learning aspect of the extention is the quiz function which both of the interviews I conducted agreed would be benificial to have.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
